Requirements:

	node.js (0.10)
	git

Preparation:

	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade
	sudo apt-get install dnsmasq (optional - if you want to run dns server yourself)

Get the code:

	git clone https://github.com/hachr/rpi-perg

Setting up:

	cd rpi-perg/session-3
	npm install

If you use dnsmasq:

	edit /etc/dnsmasq.conf and add guzzoni.apple.com <your raspberry pi ip>
	to stop the dnsmasq, run sudo service dnsmasq stop
	to start the dnsmasq, run sudo service dnsmasq start 


Set up your phone (first time, you need to install the certificate for siri to work):

	cd rpi-perg/session-3/node_modules/siri/
	sudo node install
	go to network setting on your phone and change the DNS field of the WIFI to point to the raspberry pi ip address.
	open up safari and go to http://guzzoni.apple.com. It should show you a link to install the certificate
	install the certificate and ignore the warning
	shut down the node install process (ctrl-c or kill the terminal)

Use SiriProxy:

	go to your pi, and run git clone https://github.com/hachr/rpi-perg if you haven't done it so
	go to rpi-perg/session-3/ and run npm install
	once everything is installed, run sudo node demo
	use siri to send the following commands: hello, turn on, turn off, and blink
	change the pin from 23 to whatever pin you use to trigger the LED.

Troubleshoot:

	if siri doesn't send command to your proxy, try to turn off wifi, turn it back on and give it a few seconds and try again.
